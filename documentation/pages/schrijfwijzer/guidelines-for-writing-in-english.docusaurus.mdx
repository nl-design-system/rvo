<Heading>Guidelines for writing in English </Heading>

<Heading type="h2" id="introduction">
  Introduction
</Heading>

These guidelines will help you write and edit texts for English speaking customers and ensures consistency in communication to our customers across all our English communication channels. It also contains a list with translations of frequently words, names and phrases.

The Netherlands Enterprise Agency uses British English grammar and spelling at B1 level. This language level is understandable for most of our English speaking customers. Research shows that higher literacy people also prefer plain English because it allows them to read the information as quickly as possible.

This is a working document so if you have any suggestions, questions, feedback or topics that should be included in this guide, please contact Debby van den Berg, Kanaal- en middelenspecialist English or email hoofdredactie@rvo.nl.

<Heading type="h2" id="guidelines-in-short">
  Guidelines in short
</Heading>

Our English speaking customers come from various cultural backgrounds and speak English at varying levels of fluency. English might be their second, third or even fourth language. Therefor write and edit your texts in British English at B1 level to make your writing as easy to read as possible and accessible to everyone.

You can read how to request a translation by joining the Intranet group Engelstalige content/ English content.

**Language**

We use British English grammar and spelling at B1 level, this means:

- Set your Office spellcheck to British English.
- Use simple words (plain English) and short sentences.
- Use a clear title and subheadings.
- Do not use abbreviations (afkortingen) or jargon.
- Use active sentences and avoid passive voice (lijdende vorm).
- Avoid using contractions (for example: use 'you will' and not 'you’ll').
- Check your text with the B1 English language tools.

**Tone of voice**

When writing content for our websites, letters, emails, social media posts or forms always keep the customer in mind. Stay professional and polite. In English the use of 'please' and 'thank you' are more frequently used compared to Dutch and it is a sign of politeness, respect and appreciation.

- Always be professional and polite.
- Do not use official language/jargon.
- Do not be too chatty, but remain human (avoid slang words).
- Use positive language.

**Style, spelling and grammar**

We use the same style, spelling and spelling throughout our content for clarity and consistency.

- Always use the full name the Netherlands Enterprise Agency or the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO), it does not get shortened in any way.
- Write non-English non-translatable words in italic and use a short explanation of the term in English for the foreign word.
- For the spelling of countries and cities we follow the spelling as it is used in the taxonomy list for English as published by the Hoofdredactie.
- Write all numbers as figures. Try to avoid a number at the beginning of a sentence. Commas and full stops are used the other way around in English compared to Dutch.
- The date is written as follows: \[day\] \[month\] \[year\].
- We use the 24-hour clock and Central European Time (CET) or Central European Summer Time (CEST).
- We use different types of bulleted lists: regular, continuous sentence or short points.

**Content structure, lay-out and format**

- We use the same content types and content formats as on the Dutch language website, please visit our CMS for the instructions (werkinstructies) on how to structure your content.
- Put the most important information first and make sure your content is scannable.
- Do not link to a Dutch language page from an English page, if there is no other option write (in Dutch) in brackets behind the link.

<Heading type="h2" id="language">
  Language
</Heading>

We use British English grammar and spelling at B1 level. This is the language level that is understandable for most of our customers. This also includes academic readers who also prefer B1 so they can read a text quickly. Our customers come from various cultural backgrounds and speak English at varying levels of fluency. English might be their second, third or even fourth language.

**British English versus American English**

We use British English grammar and spelling at B1 level. British English is different from American English.

How to recognise British English versus American English?

| **British English** | **American English** |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Organisation        | Organization         |
| Labour              | Labor                |
| Travelling          | Traveling            |
| Licence             | License              |
| Colour              | Color                |

An easy trick to remember. British English is often the longer and more formal version:

- ou instead of o
- double ll instead of l
- double tt instead of t
- s instead of z
- c instead of s

If third parties use US spelling in their company or organisation name, then use this spelling. For example, ‘Expat Center’ or 'World Health Organization (WHO)'.

**TIP!** Make sure to set your Office Word spell check to British English.

**B1 level English**

B1 is a level of writing that most readers understand easily. It is a lower intermediate level. Research shows that people with a university education also prefer a text that is easy to read.

- Use a clear title.
- Use subheadings.
- Use simple words that everyone knows.
- Keep sentences short and clear.
- No abbreviations (afkortingen) without an explanation.
- Use active sentences and avoid passive voice (lijdende vorm).

When you write official government content, for example about laws, schemes, or subsidies, you may have to use complex (non-B1) terms. In that case, make sure to explain each term clearly and be consistent in using that term.

**B1 words versus B1+ words**

Many English words are familiar to us, but not to B1 readers. Use the most common and simple form.

| **B1 level** | **B1+ level**      |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| About        | Regarding          |
| Before       | Prior to           |
| Buy          | Purchase           |
| Complete     | Fill in            |
| End          | Terminate          |
| Extra        | Additional         |
| If           | In the event of    |
| More than    | In excess of       |
| Send         | Forward            |
| So           | Consequently       |
| Start        | Commence           |
| Tell         | Advise             |
| Under        | In accordance with |
| You          | Applicant          |

**B1 - Avoid contractions**

To keep the text at B1 level, avoid contractions in text and quotes. Contractions can be confusing for non-native speakers.

| **Use**  | **Do not use** |
| -------- | -------------- |
| You will | You'll         |
| Is not   | Isn't          |
| Cannot   | Can't          |
| Do not   | Don't          |
| They are | They're        |

**B1 - Synonyms, the first meaning of a word**

You can use synonyms to add variation and increase readability, but when used incorrectly or too often texts will confuse readers. Keep using the same term for important words: sustainable. Not: sustainable, green and eco-friendly.

Another reason to avoid using green instead of sustainable is that the first meaning of green is colour. Non-native speakers may not pick up on the meaning in the sense of sustainability.

Different words can mean the same thing. But, all words have their first, second, and third meaning that can confuse readers. To keep the text at B1 level, use the first meaning of a word whenever possible. For example:

| **Want to say**          | **Use** | \*\* Do not use (first meaning) |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| Maximale hoogte subsidie | Limit   | Ceiling (plafond)               |
| Uitvoeren/doen           | To do   | Execute (liquideren)            |
| Niet aanwijsbare regio   | Place   | Space (de ruimte)               |

<Heading type="h2" id="tone-of-voice">
  Tone of voice
</Heading>

When writing content for our websites, letters, emails or forms always keep the customer in mind. Where possible and appropriate, address the customer directly by using 'you' in your sentences. But, do not use a turn of phrase like 'you as a restaurant owner'. Use 'If you are a restaurant owner,' or 'restaurant owners'

Always stay professional and polite. In English the use of 'please' and 'thank you' are more frequently used compared to Dutch and it is a sign of politeness, respect and appreciation. For example:

> - 'Please send back your application before the deadline.'
> - 'Thank you for your patience.'

Do not be too chatty, but remain human (not a faceless machine). Avoid using slang words. Language spoken on, for example YouTube channels or in films, is too informal and is not considered professional.

**Keep it positive**
Use positive language when communicating with our customers. This way you change a negative message in a positive message.

> - 'I advise you to'
> - 'You can prevent this by'

| **Negative**                                                                                        | **Positive**                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| If you do not send me the missing information within a week, I will not deal with your application. | Please send the missing information within a week and I will be able to finish your application. |
| You are unsuccessful.                                                                               | You are not successful.                                                                          |

Avoid using double negatives:

< 'You have not been unsuccessful.'

**Use of we or I**

Use ‘I’ (not we) in official letters. The Netherlands Enterprise Agency legally grants subsidies on behalf of the minister therefor you have to use ‘I’ (and not we).

<Heading type="h2" id="style-spelling-grammar">
  Style, spelling and grammar
</Heading>

We use the same style throughout our content for clarity and consistency.

**Use of the name the Netherlands Enterprise Agency**

Always use the full name of the Netherlands Enterprise Agency. It does not get shortened in any way. You can use 'we' or 'our'. Do not use the name RVO or Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland in English. You can use the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO).

**Foreign or non-English words**

Write non-English (foreign) non-translatable words in italic. Use a short explanation of the term in English for the foreign word.

- When using laws, names and subsidies, use the Dutch term in brackets and italics after the term in English. For example: 'Environmental Management Activities Decree (Activiteitenbesluit Milieubeheer)'.
- Acronyms are generally not italicised, as they are often used throughout texts. When first introduced, write it as follows: 'During registration, we will ask for your Citizen Service Number (Burgerservicenummer, BSN.')

**Countries and cities**

For the spelling of countries and cities we follow the taxonomy list as published by the hoofdredactie.

**TIP!** The Netherlands only starts with a capital 'T' at the beginning of a sentence. Otherwise, write 'the Netherlands'. This rule does not apply to The Hague.

**Use of capital letters**

Some general rules on whether to capitalise words.

| **Use capital letter**                         | **Example**                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Professional and personal titles               | His Majesty King Willem-Alexander             |
| Official name of embassies and missions        | The Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands |
| Laws                                           | Privacy Law                                   |
| Title of acts and decrees                      | The General Administrative Law Act            |
| Names of official documents                    | WBSO Quick Scan                               |
| Abbreviations for Dutch education institutions | MBO                                           |

| **Use capital letter**                                     | **Example**                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Job titles                                                 | David Smith, police officer              |
| General names for ministries, embassies, missions and such | In Dublin, the Dutch ministry was closed |

**Use of 'Please note'**

Use ‘please note’ only if there is really something noteworthy.

Begin a sentence with **Please note** (bold) and the sentence that follows with a capital letter.

> **Please note**: This manual will be updated on 28 March 2025.

**Quotes**

Quotes have a special function. They are personal, represent what has been said, and show emotion. Try not to change quotes. If necessary, you can:

- add punctuation;
- ums and ahems can be removed;
- bad grammar improved;
- re-write contractions.

If you are not sure of the exact wording, use indirect speech.

**Quotation marks**

- Use single quotation marks for the titles of 'publications' and such.
- If you quote a complete sentence, the full stop is part of that sentence and comes before the closing quotation mark: "I really cannot get my head around this."
- This is also correct if you quote a full sentence: He said, "I will not surrender."
- But, if you add the ‘he said’ part to the end of the sentence, it is: "I will not surrender", he said.
- Use double quotation marks for "quotes". When using direct speech, use a verb and comma (,) instead of a colon (:)

| **Do**                                                 | **Do not**                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Mr Jansen continues, "Thanks to the coaching process," | Mr Jansen continues: "Thanks to the coaching process," |

**(Official) job titles**

In quotes, running texts, documents, or articles we often refer to people. Make sure to use the right format.

You cannot refer to people with only their last name without a title. Except in the case of criminals.

| **When**                                                   | **Form**                                       | **Example**                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Introduction of a person with official job title           | \[job title\], \[first name\] \[last name\]    | Minister of Economic Affairs, Jan Jansen             |
| Introduction of a person with regular job title            | \[first name\] \[last name]\, \[job title\]    | Pietje Puk, school teacher                           |
| Second, third. mention of a person with official job title | \[official job title\] \[last name\] \[verb\], | Minister of Economic Affairs Jansen continues, "XXX" |
| Second, third. mention of a person with regular job title  | \[name\] \[verb\],                             | Mr Puk continues, "XXX"                              |

**TIP!** Mr, Mrs, Ms do not have a full stop. It is: Mr Smith and Ms Andrews.

**Abbreviations and acronyms – afkortingen en acroniemen**

Write the names of organisations, laws, decisions in full the first time, followed by the short capitalised version in brackets.

For example, European Union (EU). You do not have to share the full names of acronyms when the acronym is more known than the full name. Think of organisations such as HEMA, NS, and NASA.

Frequently used abbreviations:

- NGO
- SMEs
- AOW
- Ministry of Foreign Affairs (BZ)
- UNESCO
- the UK

**TIP!** Keep in mind that abbreviations of subsidies do not need ‘the’.

> 'You can apply for WBSO.' (Not: 'You can apply for the WBSO'.)

**Hyphen (liggend streepje)**

Rule of thumb: hyphenate two or more words only when used as an adjective.

| **Hyphenate**         | **Do not hyphenate**          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| A 3-year old document | I work at a startup           |
| High-quality products | This product has high quality |

The following words are often misspelled in English:

- email (without hyphen)
- small and medium-sized (only 1 hyphen)
- startup (without hyphen)

**Bulleted lists**

Use lists if you want to draw the reader’s attention. Lists also keep sentences short, the text scannable and highlight examples or elements.

_Regular list style_
Start each item with a lowercase letter, and do not use a full stop at the end.

> For the subsidy you will need:
>
> - all required documents
> - a declaration of independence from your local government
> - completed Quick Scan

_Continuous sentence_

With a list that is part of a continuous sentence, put semicolons (;) after each point and start each bullet point with a lower-case letter.

> If you can prove that:
>
> - you were somewhere else at the time;
> - you were not related to Mary; and
> - you are over 21;
>
> you should be all right.

_Numbered lists_

Use numbered lists instead of bulleted lists when the order of the items is relevant. Items in a numbered list should end in a full stop because each should be a complete sentence.

> 1. Delivery address.
> 2. Payment.
> 3. Confirmation.

**Singular vs plural object**

It is common in Dutch to write generalised statements about 'the entrepreneur' (de ondernemer), meaning 'entrepreneurs as a group'. In English, it is more common to use the plural form. See the following example:

| **NL**                                                                                 | **ENG Do**                                                                          | **ENG Do not**                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| De ondernemer is verplicht om zijn klant een factuur te sturen met de juiste gegevens. | Businessowners must send **their** clients an invoice with the correct information. | The businessowner must send **his** client an invoice with the correct information. |

**He/she vs they**

Given the above, it follows that the generalised subject in Dutch texts often is referred to with gendered pronouns. Usually, the pronoun used is 'hij' (he) or the more inclusive 'hij/zij' (he/she).

In English, you can use the neutral pronoun 'they', even if the grammatical subject of your sentence is singular. If the gender of your subject is unknown, 'they/them' is preferable. For example:

| **NL**                                                                                                                  | **ENG Do**                                                                                                        | **ENG Do not**                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| In dit voorbeeld heeft de ondernemer recht op EIA vanwege zijn investering in maatregelen ten behoeve van CO2-reductie. | In this example, the entrepreneur is entitled to EIA because of **their** investment in measures that reduce CO2. | In this example, the entrepreneur is entitled to EIA because of **his** investment in measures that reduce CO2. |

**Singular v plural**

Even though a country sounds plural, we treat it as singular. This goes for the United States and the Netherlands. For example 'the Netherlands is a small country'.

To refer to a specific decade, do as follows:

> - In the 1970s we had a blast.
> - The 1990s were fabulous.

Do not use brackets to denote one of several options. Choose 'motorbike or bike', not '(motor)bike'. Only when you want to show singular or plural this is permitted in English, for example, book(s).

**TIP!** There is no plural ’s in English, so write: photos, euros, NGOs, SMEs.

**Numbers, date, time, measurements, currencies**

The correct use of numbers, date, time, measurements and currencies is important for our customers. They do not want to miss a deadline, submit the wrong details or expect a different amount. Use the following rules:

_Numbers_

Write numbers as figures. Try to avoid a number at the beginning of a sentence. When using a number at the beginning of a sentence, the following word is not capitalised.

In English:

- we use commas instead of full stops to separate thousands: 1,000 or 33,647
- we use full stops instead of commas to specify decimals: 1,000.99 or 33,647.00

To shorten a large number, write: 3.5 million, not 3½ million or 3.5M

**TIP!** Write ordinal numbers (1st and so on) without superscript. To make sure digital devices read the number out loud correctly. Even better: write out the full word. Such as first, second up until 20.

_Dates_

\[day\] \[month\] \[year\] and when relevant add the day of the week + comma.

> Examples:
>
> - You can apply from 31 March 2024.
> - The event takes place on Friday, 13 April 2024.

If you are noting a period, you generally do not repeat the same year or month, unless it is crucial for legal purposes.

> Examples:
>
> - The application period runs from 15 May to 20 April 2021.
> - The event takes place from 15 to 20 August 2021.
> - The law will remain in force from 30 June 2019 to 25 October 2022.

_Time_

We use the 24-hour clock. The Netherlands has summer and winter time. Therefore we use both Central European Time (CET) and Central European Summer Time (CEST).

Use the following rules:

> - 31 July 2024 09:00 CEST
> - 21 January 2024 17:00 CET
> - You can apply from 1 March 09:00 CET to 1 April 17:00 CEST 2020.

_Measurements_

Since our readers come from all over the world we need to be clear about measurements. In the Netherlands and in British English we use the metric system as a standard. Even though we have this standard, do not forget to add the measurement to the number.

> Examples:
>
> - 41,450 km2
> - 16,038 square miles (wijkt af, dus volledig)
> - 50 m2
> - 25%
> - 90° C
> - 70° Fahrenheit (wijkt af, dus volledig)

_Currencies_

The euro is our standard currency. To avoid confusion always mention the currency. Use the following rules:

- There should be no space between the currency sign and the number: €10,000 or US$9.99.
- The word euro (plural: euros) is written with a lower case letter.
- Specify US dollars (US$) to distinguish from Australian/Canadian dollars.
- When the options above are not suitable and you want to name the currency, use the ISO standard abbreviations (EUR, USD, GBP).

> Examples:
>
> - The costs are €1,000 for the car.
> - The return was 2.7 million euros.
> - Our company needs 8.6 billion GBP.

  Content structure, lay-out and format
</Heading>

Please read the 'werkinstructies' in our CMS to find out more about how to best structure your text. The same instructions apply for English as well as the Dutch website. You can also find the instructions on how to link your English page to the corresponding Dutch page or other pages or documents.

Always put the most important information first and make sure your content is scannable.

**Links**

Link to English-language pages or information only. If this is not available, there are 3 options:

1. Does the link go to a web page/tool/form with mainly numbers, addresses, or other information that a non-Dutch speaker might easily understand? Use the link to the Dutch page.
2. Does the link go to a form or tool that the customer needs, for example, to apply? Use the Dutch link. Explain that you are linking to a form or tool that is only available in Dutch.
3. Does the link go to a website with essential information that the customer cannot do without? Translate the information and customise it to the English speaking customer. This means that you might have to give a more in-depth explanation.

**Please note**: If you link to a Dutch page, signal this to the reader by including '(in Dutch)' behind the link.

<Heading type="h2" id="words-to-avoid">
  Words to avoid
</Heading>

Plain English is mandatory for all of Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO) so avoid using these words:

- agenda (unless it’s for a meeting), use ‘plan’ instead
- advance, use ‘improve’ or something more specific
-	collaborate, use ‘work with’
-	combat (unless military), use ‘solve’, ‘fix’ or something more specific
- commit/pledge, use ‘plan to x’, or ‘we’re going to x’ where ‘x’ is a specific verb
- counter, use ‘prevent’ or try to rephrase a solution to a problem
- deliver, use ‘make’, ‘create’, ‘provide’ or a more specific term (pizzas, post and services are delivered - not abstract concepts like improvements)
- deploy (unless it’s military or software), use ‘use’ or if putting something somewhere use ‘build’, ‘create’ or ‘put into place’
- dialogue, use ‘spoke to’ or ‘discussion’
- disincentivise, use ‘discourage’ or ‘deter’
- empower, use ‘allow’ or ‘give permission’
- facilitate, say something specific about how you’re helping - for example, use ‘run’ if talking about a workshop
- focus, use ‘work on’ or ‘concentrate on’
- foster (unless it’s children), use ‘encourage’ or ‘help’
- impact (unless talking about a collision), use ‘have an effect on’ or ‘influence’
- incentivise, use ‘encourage’ or ‘motivate’
- initiate, use ‘start’ or ‘begin’
- key (unless it unlocks something), usually not needed but can use ‘important’ or ‘significant’
- land (unless you’re talking about aircraft), depending on context, use ‘get’ or ‘achieve’
- leverage (unless in the financial sense), use ‘influence’ or ‘use’
- liaise, use ‘work with’ or ‘work alongside’
- overarching, usually superfluous but can use ‘encompassing’
- progress, use ‘work on’ or ‘develop’ or ‘make progress’
- promote (unless talking about an ad campaign or career advancement), use ‘recommend’ or ‘support’
- robust (unless talking about a sturdy object), depending on context, use ‘well thought out’ or ‘comprehensive’
- slim down (unless talking about one’s waistline), use ‘make smaller’ or ‘reduce the size’
- streamline, use ‘simplify’ or ‘remove unnecessary administration’
- strengthening (unless it’s strengthening bridges or other structures), depending on context, use ‘increasing funding’ or ‘concentrating on’ or ‘adding more staff’
- tackle (unless talking about fishing tackle or a physical tackle, like in rugby), use ‘stop’, ‘solve’ or ‘deal with’
- transform, describe what you’re doing to change the thing
- utilise, use ‘use’

Avoid using metaphors - they do not say what you actually mean and lead to slower comprehension of your content. For example:

- drive, use ‘create’, ‘cause’ or ‘encourage’ instead (you can only drive vehicles, not schemes or people)
- drive out (unless it’s cattle), use ‘stop’, ‘avoid’ or ‘prevent’
- going/moving forward, use ‘from now on’ or ‘in the future’ (it’s unlikely we are giving travel directions)
- in order to, usually not needed - do not use it
- one-stop shop, use ‘website’ (we are government, not a retail outlet)
- ring fencing, use ‘separate’ or when talking about budgets use ‘money that will be spent on x’

With all of these words you can generally replace them by breaking the term into what you’re actually doing. Be open and specific.

<Heading type="h2" id="inclusivity">
  Inclusivity words to use and avoid
</Heading>

Some basic guidelines.

**Collective terms and labels**

The word 'disabled' is a description not a group of people. Use 'disabled people' not 'the disabled' as the collective term.

Don't automatically refer to 'disabled people' in all communications – many people who need disability benefits and services don't identify with this term. Consider using 'people with health conditions or impairments' if it seems more appropriate.

_Positive not negative_

Avoid phrases like 'suffers from' which suggest discomfort, constant pain and a sense of hopelessness.

Wheelchair users may not view themselves as 'confined to' a wheelchair – try thinking of it as a mobility aid instead.

_Everyday phrases_

Most disabled people are comfortable with the words used to describe daily living. People who use wheelchairs 'go for walks' and people with visual impairments may be very pleased – or not – 'to see yo'. An impairment may just mean that some things are done in a different way.

Common phrases that may associate impairments with negative things should be avoided, for example 'deaf to our pleas' or 'blind drunk'.

**Words to use and avoid**

Avoid passive, victim words. Use language that respects disabled people as active individuals with control over their own lives.
